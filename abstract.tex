This paper describes a format of binary encoding of complex data types,
that should not be able to
break or confuse the decoder because of encoding related inconsistencies
('grammatical mistakes').
The general principle can be summarized as 'every bit is meaningful'.
It provides a pseudo code algorithm for the decoder,
discusses potential encoding variations, provides reference examples,
compares with other encodings and discusses the advantages
and disadvantages of the format.
