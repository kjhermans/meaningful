This paper describes a format of binary encoding of complex data types,
that should not be able to
break or confuse the decoder because of encoding related inconsistencies
('grammatical mistakes').
It provides a pseudo code algorithm for the decoder,
discusses potential encoding variations, provides reference examples,
compares with other encodings and discusses the advantages
and disadvantages of the format.
