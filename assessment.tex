\section{Assessment}

\subsection{Advantages}

\begin{itemize}
\item The format is ultimately streaming: the decoder never has to have
      more than sizeof(double) into its buffer, no 'looking back' is
      ever required.
\item In spite of that, a complex structure a la JSON/XML/ASN.1 can be
      encoded.
\item In fact, using the larger concept, \textit{any} structure can
      be encoded.
\item While the decoder \textit{cannot fail}.
\item Therefore, cannot fail mid-decoding either (you can receive
      partial messages and still have a valid encoding).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Disadvantages}

\begin{itemize}
\item (In this implementation:)
      string encoding carries a penalty of 12.5\% overhead in the limit.
\item Encoding and decoding may not be deterministically linked: the same
      chaos may not be returned when passed through the decoder and encoder
      subsequently (the reverse order however, does deterministically link
      the encoder and the decoder).
\end{itemize}
